---SUMMARY---

Module aims to let users define some design elements such as banner background
images, videos, etc.

---INSTALLATION---

Install as usual at /admin/extend. Grant the relevant permissions to the desired
roles at /admin/user/permissions.

---CUSTOM BACKGROUND IMAGES---

1. Make sure the "edit custom banners" has been added to the desired role(s).

2. Upload a background image or video using the settings form at /admin/appearance/custom-design.

3. Use the {{ custom_bg_url }} variable in html.html.twig or page.html.twig to
outpute an image or video url.

4. Wrap the url in an HTML element or inline style to display the output. A {{ custom_bg_type }}
variable is included for any necessary if-then-else conditionals, etc. (For example, a video
background can be included by including a <video> tag.)

5. Futher formatting—background videos, for example—can be provided using additional css.
